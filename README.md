# Sentiment Analysis Project

The project aimed to analyze sentiment in reviews from platforms like Amazon, Yelp, and IMDB, categorizing them as positive or negative. Data sourced from UCI Machine Learning Repository was merged, cleaned, and utilized for model training. The entire process is detailed in the Project_Flask_Sentiment.ipynb file.

After that I built a Flask application and deployed it on [render]( https://fourgeeks-flask-integration-8i52.onrender.com/).
